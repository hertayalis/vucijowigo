He was all of 23 years old and had been slogging his way toward something resembling a film career since dropping out of college when an injury ended his football scholarship. Walsh is generally credited with changing Marion's name. The director was spending off-moments reading a biography of Revolutionary War General "Mad Anthony" Wayne during the shoot; Marion was friends with another movie upstart, John Ford. Marion chose John, Walsh chose Wayne, and a star â€” wasn't quite born. Although The Big Trail was something of an epic for the time, it was a dud, and now-John Wayne labored for nearly 10 years in low-budget westerns, even a series portraying a singing <a href=#>cowboy</a> named Sandy. "John Wayne" became synonymous with a movie stereotype, coupled with Marion/John's outspoken conservative political views. An Academy Award awaited him for 1969's <a href=#>True Grit</a>, and through it all, his good friends still called him Duke. Not Marion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9mHJna21fnby4ecmon6dlp5bGr7GMoKatZZiewG61wqiloptdo66usY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
