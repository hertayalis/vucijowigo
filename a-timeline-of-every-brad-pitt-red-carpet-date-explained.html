Early fans of Pitt may remember that he and McCall attended a screening of the CBS miniseries Windmills of the Gods&nbsp;in West Hollywood, where the two looked happy as could be&nbsp;in full view of the cameras. They also showed up together at <a href=#>a Valentine's Day gala</a> that same year. Fresh-faced and always outfit-coordinated, the pair played the perfect match.</p><p>That's not surprising considering they were co-stars on Dallas, a show that cast him as Randy, the boyfriend of McCall's character, Charlie Wade. Fans were used to <a href=#>seeing them in a romance onscreen</a>, but having met just "an hour" before shooting their first romantic scene together, McCall told&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;"it wasn't awkward," adding, "We were laughing and kidding around."&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the fact they they were <a href=#>reportedly dating</a>&nbsp;in real life was somewhat scandalous considering he was about 24 at the time and she was only 15! And, to be honest, this wasn't the only relationship that Pitt was supposedly involved in that featured an inappropriate (and illegal?) age gap. But more on that later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFhboF3e8Bmq6KllaG2r7GMqJ1mnaaav7p5wauYnWWgnsG1edGem2abkae9psCMnZitnV2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
