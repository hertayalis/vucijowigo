In between these ventures, Scheana appeared on the Disney Channel series Jonas, the popular Nickelodeon sitcom Victorious, and had a guest role on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>90210</strong></a>.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Shay appeared on the third season of the teen drama series back in 2010, shortly after appearing on The Hills for three episodes.

But for a more dramatic type of role, that I needed to learn how to control my eyebrows.” This advice gave some pretty mixed signals for the former actress, as she was balancing roles on kids’ shows, as well as trying out for more mature TV roles.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>“They were like, ‘The role is yours, here’s your callback. The role is yours, we want you for this, but we’re bringing in a couple other girls as well because if you can’t control your facial features then we’re not going to give it to you,” Shay continued.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Sounds like Scheana’s brief acting career is not something she’s particularly nostalgic for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4rdJmqpyglZa7onnSoZiyZZ%2Bjenp8kWpnaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
