Between 1967 and 1997, he competed in boxing under the name “Big George.” Foreman has two heavyweight world titles and an Olympic gold to his name. He is well known for creating the George Foreman Grill.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=George_Foreman_Wiki></span><span><strong>George Foreman Wiki</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>After having a difficult upbringing, Foreman decided to try amateur boxing, and at the 1968 Summer Olympics he won gold in the heavyweight division. George turned professional the next year, and in 1973, he upset Joe Frazier in the second round to win the heavyweight championship. George twice successfully defended the title until losing to Muhammad Ali in renowned Rumble 1974, which marked his first defeat in the professional ring.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/George-Foreman-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_And_Education></span><span><strong>Parents And Education</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The birthplace of George Foreman is Marshall, Texas. With six siblings, he was raised in Houston, Texas’ Fifth Ward neighbourhood. Leroy Moorehead was George’s biological father, even though he was raised by Foreman, whom his mother had married when George was a young child. He was an upbringing that was troubled, as he acknowledged in his memoirs. At the age of 15, he left school and worked as a mugger. When George was 16, Foreman had a change of heart and persuaded his mother to enrol him in the Job Corps after seeing an advertisement for the organisation on television.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/George-Foreman-Parents.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span><span><strong>Career</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>With a three-round knockout of Donald Walheim in New York City, Foreman made his professional debut. He fought 13 times in all that year, winning each one. With victories in all 12 of his contests, Foreman continued ascent to the undisputed heavyweight championship in 1970. Gregorio Peralta was one of the opponents he beat, albeit Peralta demonstrated that Foreman was susceptible to quick counterpunches combined with an assertive fighting style. After three rounds, Foreman eliminated George Chuvalo via technical knockout. After this victory, Foreman defeated Boone Kirkman in three rounds and Charlie Polite in four.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/George-Foreman-Career.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Retirement></span><span><strong>Retirement</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>In spite of being cordial and philosophical about losing to Briggs, Foreman soon announced his “final” retirement. He did, however, intend to face Larry Holmes again in 1999; the pay-per-view match was set to take place at the Houston Astrodome. Due to both competitors’ imminent birthdays, the fight was to be dubbed The Birthday Bash. Prior to the breakdown of negotiations and the cancellation of the bout, Foreman was scheduled to earn $10 million while Holmes was scheduled to earn $4 million. Foreman continued to have a passion for the game and rose to prominence as an HBO boxing pundit.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship></span><span><strong>Relationship</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Since 1985, Foreman has married to Mary Joan Martelly.
