That’s a better longevity than some of Hollywood’s biggest stars can boast. Flo has enjoyed broad success, so much so that very few people know the woman behind the character.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Flo is played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephanie Courtney</a>, an actress who — despite being instantly recognizable as Progressive’s perky spokesperson — has found work in several television and film projects over the years. She is by far best known as Flo, however, and continues to helm nearly every commercial and advertisement put out by the insurance company.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Over the course of more than a decade, Flo has appeared in more than 100 advertisements. She’s enjoyed more screen time than the vast majority of advertising mascots and continues to appear in commercials 14 years after her debut.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Flo from Progressive’s net worth</strong></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Progressive Insurance (@progressive)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Flo’s enduring popularity has elevated her to previously unforeseen heights amongst advertising regulars. While Courtney is unlikely to ever enjoy the name recognition of some of today’s working actresses, she rakes in top dollar for her appearances as Flo.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Her decade and a half in Progressive commercials have helped Flo has accumulate a net worth of $6 million. While it pales in comparison to the biggest earners in Hollywood, Flo’s millionaire status is undeniably impressive, particularly considering her general lack of non-Progressive-oriented work.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Flo reportedly makes around $1 million a year, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, but very likely brings in closer to $2 million on an annual basis. Her status as Progressive’s official spokesperson helps immensely in negotiations where her paychecks are concerned and assists Courtney in continuing to rake in the big bucks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZu5sHnFq6amZaCnvKi%2BxKyqoq6VqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
