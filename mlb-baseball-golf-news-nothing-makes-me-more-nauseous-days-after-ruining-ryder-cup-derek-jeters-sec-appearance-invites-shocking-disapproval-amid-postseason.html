The former&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>New York Yankees</a> player is back with his beloved baseball as an analyst. Reporting for FOX Sports, the ex-slugger has reunited with former teammate Alex Rodriguez for the postseason. While the current Yankees didnâ€™t make it to October, fans are glad to see someone in pinstripes. But itâ€™s not all sunshine and roses for Captain Clutch.</p><p>During his active years, Jeter was considered one of the most marketable faces in the league. His talent on the diamond already made him beloved to the Bronx. But commercials and sponsorships featuring the Captainâ€™s face made him even more popular. However, the trend has apparently failed to translate to post-retirement advertisements.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Just Like the Ryder Cup, Derek Jeter and Jeep Ruined the Postseason</h2><p>A few weeks ago, team USA suffered one humiliating defeat after another at the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Ryder Cup</a>. Despite boasting talent, they had to bow down to Europeâ€™s supremacy. The salt on the wound was, surprisingly, Derek Jeter. The retired baseballer has not stopped filming commercials because his fan value is as high as ever. The latest one has to do with his vehicular choices.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nothing makes me more nauseous than Derek Jeterâ€™s Grand Wagoneer commercial. $100k Jeep? Gtfoh</p><p>â€” Saint Douglas (@DougWoodlands) <a href=#>October 8, 2023</a></p><p>Father of four, Jeter first partnered up with Jeep in 2022, then a parent to three daughters. The Grand Wagoneer, given its huge space, was a perfect fit for the family. Announcing the birth of his son in May, the family expanded even more, so a bigger car was in order. A few weeks ago, the former shortstop announced another collab with the car brand, this time for the Grand Wagoneer L.</p><p>To promote it, Jeter drives all night through bad weather to his family, depicting the carâ€™s durability, among other features. Itâ€™s a sweet concept but when the video was shown over and over again <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>during the Ryder Cup</a>, fans were frustrated. The same is now happening in the ongoing MLB postseason, and fans are more than fed up. Most have strong feelings and will not be contained.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>MLB Fans Cannot Believe Jeter Drives a Jeep</h2><p>While car preferences are personal to everyone, theyâ€™re still worth being made fun of, if fans are to be believed. Taking to social media to express their disbelief, many could not get over the fact that Jeter drove a Jeep.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY â€“ <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>From Alex â€˜A-Rodâ€™ Rodriguez to Derek Jeter: Here Are the Top 5 Richest MLB Players of All Time</a></strong></p><p>One simply laughed over it.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Am I really supposed to believe Jeter drives a Jeep Grand Wagoneer?
