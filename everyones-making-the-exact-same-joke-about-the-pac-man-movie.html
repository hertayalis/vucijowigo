Spearheaded by the mind of Chuck Williams, who was responsible for 2020’s Sonic the Hedgehog (a film that could very well ramp up into a cinematic universe if its sequels stay steady), the Pac-Man prospect is one that should be exercised with equal parts fascination and caution; how could it possibly work, and will we get a Galaga mid-credits scene?</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>But the world of entertainment wouldn’t have a fraction of its traction without the internet’s incessant reflex to make everything into a meme, and it seems everyone had the same idea when they caught wind of such a project.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chris Pratt on his way to voice the live-action PAC-MAN <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Q8WKXYvGNK</a></p>— brenton (@dcuverse) <a href=#>August 8, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>With Hollywood’s most controversial Chris making some unsavory rounds on Twitter again, it seemed the perfect time to plunge the actor into a ridiculous hypothetical that, if we cast our minds back to the events of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, may not be that ridiculous after all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chris Pratt will return as Pac-Man. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QM2KjfMFFN</a></p>— I am Flash (@IamFlash00) <a href=#>August 8, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>The good people of Twitter, of course, are referring to the scene in James Gunn’s sophomore MCU project where Star-Lord, played by Chris Pratt faces off against his father, Ego. During the fight, Star-Lord dons a husk of various debris made to resemble Pac-Man before crashing into his father.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>You all may joke about Chris Pratt playing Pac-Man in the movie.

We already know Pratt is set to voice a certain world-famous plumber in the upcoming Super Mario Bros. film project, so why not expand his library of films adapted from video games with Namco’s number-one dot muncher?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonK%2Bdoq68r7HSZqSao5mjtG7Ax55knrCRmMFuv8CmnGain6Cybq3BqKytZaSdsm68wJxkppmeYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
