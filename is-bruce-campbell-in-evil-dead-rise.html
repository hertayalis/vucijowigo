It’s been an even longer since we saw <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce Campbell</a></strong> in his role as Ash on the big screen, with the actor not having appeared in a feature film in the franchise since 1993 in Army of Darkness.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Granted, we did get to see Campbell reprise his role in the television series Ash vs Evil Dead for three gory and spectacular seasons which wrapped up not too long ago (comparatively) in 2018, so when the title and release date of the long awaited fifth movie <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Evil Dead Rise</a></strong> was announced, surely it meant that Ash would be making a comeback to hack and slash his way across the silver screen once more, right?</p><h2 id=h-is-bruce-campbell-involved-with-evil-dead-rise data-injectable=false>Is Bruce Campbell involved with Evil Dead Rise?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-494795784-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>Sadly, Bruce Campbell will not be reprising his role as the iconic Ash when Evil Dead Rises releases later this year. The actor is still tied to the film as executive producer, but he has otherwise hung up his chainsaw when it comes to the iconic character.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>For devout fans of the franchise, this shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise. Back in 2021 in an interview with <a href=#>Collider</a>, Campbell confirmed that he had effectively retired from the role of Ash for future Evil Dead projects. Evil Dead Rise will instead introduce a new cast of characters, but will still serve as a sequel to its preceding films.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=846 data-injectable=false>That said, Ash won’t be entirely absent from the upcoming film, but bar some sort of big reveal when we see it in cinemas, we won’t be seeing him on screen. Instead, we’ll be getting a little bit of voiceover from Campbell in his role, as he confirmed at San Diego Comic Con last year. Whether it’s narration, a voice from the beyond, or even reused lines from the old movies to use as a bridging device, we’ll have to find out when Evil Dead Rise hits theaters on April 21, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlkqfCpLGMnJimqJKaua15yKdknq6ZoXqlscCdZKuho5p8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
