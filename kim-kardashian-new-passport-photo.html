Speaking on the American TV show, Kim told how her perfect wedding had been subject to a few hiccups â€“ including a last-minute cancellation which played havoc with their seating plan. Rather than setting out place cards, the bride and groom had etched the names of their guests into the table: "Because everyone is engraved in our hearts," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ce02ccdd74ce-kim-walking-a.jpg> <strong>Kim spoke of her wedding on Jimmy Kimmel Live this week</strong><p id=elyYFF6JWwJs data-wc=112>This, of course, created huge problems with&nbsp;the no-show. "It was the worst," explained Kim. "We tried to put white paint and cover the name, [but it didn't work]." The reality TV beauty also revealed how the couple's plans to surprise their guests with their Italian wedding location were ruined when the press got hold of the story. "It kind of sucked," she admitted. "We really wanted to surprise everyone and say it was a different country [to France]." Explaining the reasons behind choosing cities in France and Italy, Kim said: "We fell in love in Paris, I got pregnant with our daughter in Florence... we wanted to share our love story."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbWdxaGZnfXOFkWiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK7psOMqZisq6Ckv7V5z6Gmradf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
