She graduated cum laude, and then while studying for an MBA, discovered her passion for tattoo artistry. After graduating, she decided to fully pursue a career in the field, and in a short time, she earned a reputation as a respected tattoo artist, and so decided to move to New York City to expand to a larger audience, and she was hired by the popular tattoo shop “Black Ink”. She is the only female tattoo artist employed by the company, and over time they all became part of the television series “Black Ink Crew”. The series showcases the daily lives of the shop as well as the staff. One of the more notable personalities in the show is Ceaser Emanuel who owns the tattoo parlor, but they are all seen tattooing high profile clients, and the popularity of the show has certainly propelled Lattimore’s career and net worth upwards.</p><p>Due to her popularity on the show, Dutchess was given opportunities to be featured in various tattoo publications, including Urban Ink and Inked, and now she works part time as a model aside from her work as a tattoo artist.
