The man behind one of the most successful shows of the 2010s, and the face of the resurgence of adult animation, is now almost completely dead to his former fans.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Roiland has been embroiled in controversy relating to his personal life, with him being charged with domestic violence in Jan. 2023 for incidents in 2020. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The writer faced charges including</a> one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury, and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud, and/or deceit.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimately those charges were dropped in March</a> but it ended up opening a can of worms for Roiland. It turns out the situation is much worse and deeper than the first reports suggested, with more people coming forward detailing additional alleged misconduct and harassment.</p><h2 id=h-alleged-justin-roiland-dm-controversy data-injectable=false>Alleged Justin Roiland DM controversy</h2><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Following the domestic battery charges, more people have come forward detailing Roiland’s ongoing poor behavior. DMs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly sent by Roiland to Allie Goertz have now been made public</a>. Goertz, a musician and former editor for Mad revealed messages sent to her by Roiland after she gained fame from a Rick and Morty concept album in 2015.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>The vulgar messages sent to Goertz involved his request for a song on the album around penises of different racial groups hanging down her face as she is “splattered with semen” but the song would be about “NO MORE RACISM”. Roiland then backs it up with further off-putting comments including the use of a homophobic slur, before attempting to throw a lampshade on it by being drunk.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ll say more later. For now, I’ll just share the types of “funny” DMs Justin Roiland would send me. (Posted and deleted this last night because I was worried about any backlash. But this dude made ME – someone who wrote a Rick & Morty concept album – never watch his show again) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xLYE7j7tgH</a></p>— Allie Goertz (@AllieGoertz) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-injectable=false>Alleged texts sent to a 16-year-old fan</h2><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>Other texts which have been attributed to Roiland have also been unearthed from 2015, in which he made sexually suggestive comments towards a teenage fan. He jokes that she should go into sex slavery, before describing her as “jailbait” (a term used to describe underage girls who are deemed attractive by adults).</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Roiland also suggests the fan go into “cam whoring” (adult webcam streaming) when she turns 18, before asking if the FBI follows her around for being “jailbait”. Messaging an underage fan in the first place is already an uncomfortable ground to tread, but the remarks and use of the same homophobic slur seem to be a recurring theme for him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Na fuck Justin Roiland. I feel sick for ever watching Rick And Morty. This man is fucking vile. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9aOcKvCPkO</a></p>— 🎄Sam 🎄 (@AGalaxyDivided) <a href=#>January 16, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Roiland has not commented on whether or not he sent these messages, but there does appear to be a greater pattern of him making off-color remarks. Old interviews have also resurfaced where he makes jokes about not being able to have sex with underage girls as young as 13, saying society has gotten too “precious”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>straight from Justin Roiland’s mouth: “100 years ago it was little 13 year old girls — if they were built like a woman they were getting married and having kids. and now we’re going to be all Precious about it?” <a href=#>https://t.co/83p1GCx6qM</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/orJNtUZ6cI</a></p>— the demon seed of davey jones (@opossumopunk) <a href=#>January 15, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>While jokes are different from reality, there is a clear throughline of his jokes involving sexuality and underage girls, as well as the usage of slurs and graphic imagery. The leaked DMs may not be real, but given Goertz’s reputation very much being on the line with her leaking her DMs, it paints a very poor picture if they are.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>As previously mentioned; the domestic violence charges were dropped against Roiland; although by this point Adult Swim had already cut ties with the Rick and Morty creator. It seems there wasn’t sufficient evidence to charge him but it’s unlikely he will be returning to work for the network.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The case may have been dismissed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but fans are still asking about those creepy PMs</a> which is definitely a fair question if you ask me. Roiland has yet to comment on them and it’s uncertain if he ever will.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=false>If you are experiencing domestic abuse, or if you believe someone you know is being abused, contact&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>.
