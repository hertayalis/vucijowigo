I think it‚Äôs really hard for people who are Christian and do have that belief that marriage belongs to a man and a woman. But when your daughter falls in love with someone and you love that person, you can‚Äôt just say you don‚Äôt believe in it.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=false>She also said she didn‚Äôt want to put words in his mouth but that she‚Äôs always felt love and support from her father.
