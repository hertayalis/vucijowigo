That really moved me."</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Joseph Allen</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">May 9 2024, Published 10:43 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Over the years, <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a> and <a href=#>John Mayer</a> have become known for drama, although for very different reasons. John has a long list of exes, and Andy has often stirred up drama through his mastery of the Bravo universe. <a href=#>John and Andy</a> have long been friendly with one another, though, so much so that it's actually sparked rumors that there's something more going on.</p><p>John and Andy have a long history together, and it includes John's appearance at Andy's baby shower and his presence when Andy received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Are the two in an actual relationship, though? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Andy Cohen dating John Mayer?</h2><p>Andy and John don't appear to be dating, although Andy has suggested that he doesn't put a box on their relationship.</p><p>“Let them speculate! I honestly love John Mayer, and he loves me,” he told <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “But because we’re so affectionate toward each other, people don’t know what box to put that in.”</p><p>To add some more clarity, he said: “They assume we’re sleeping with each other, which we are most definitely not.”</p><p>So Andy and John's relationship doesn't seem to be romantic, but that doesn't mean that the two of them aren't close.</p><p>During his Hollywood Walk of Fame induction, John said some genuinely kind things about his friend.</p><p>"He's a Madonna stan and a Deadhead. He's an A-lister, who parties like a B-lister, with the free spirit of a C-lister," Mayer said at the ceremony.</p><p>"I love Andy more than I can tell you," John continued. "He's a brilliant human being, a hilarious cohort, a loving son and brother — and more recently he's become a proud, engaged, and deeply devoted father."</p><p>Andy said that John's speech had moved him when speaking to The Hollywood Reporter. “When he inducted me into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, John Mayer said that I unwittingly have become a gay best friend to people who never had a gay best friend. That really moved me.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Andy once said he and John were 'in love with each other.'</h2><p>These comments come after Andy said during an appearance on The Howard Stern Show that he and John were "in love with each other." That became major news, because of course it did.</p><p>"It became headline news. And the more it became headline news, the more butthurt I got over it," he said. "You know why? Are two men not allowed to say that they're in love? Are we all so flipped out?"</p><p>The two have never dated or had a sexual relationship, but it seems that they do have deep affection for one another.</p><p style=text-align:start>"He very quickly in our friendship started saying, 'You know what, I gotta tell you something — I love you,'" Andy explained. "He is someone to say, 'I love you and I cherish you and I cherish our friendship' — just this stuff that straight guys aren't necessarily supposed to say."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurc2dsGabn52yr3nDmquippdit7C0zWakmrGVpw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
