The first verse indicates that the million faces represent the promises that have been made to her, which she can sense in her bones but are slipping away from her grasp. However, the joy of singing with all her might creates a sense of wonder and comfort. She also reassures her listeners that they are not alone in their struggles.</p><br><p>In the second verse, the reasons for her life are buried in deep recesses and can only be found through words that will evoke them. In the face of madness and oppression, she perseveres, and the reasons for her life cannot be bought or sold. The reasons have filled her spaces and are like rushing waters that flow and guide her, untangling her from the burdens she carries. Despite not knowing all the reasons for her life, she is grateful for the ones she possesses.</p><br><p>The song speaks to the idea that life is full of promises, experiences, and emotions that define us. The reasons for our lives, whether they are apparent or buried deep within us, make our existence meaningful. The song encourages listeners to appreciate the beauty of the small things that make life worth living and to find comfort in the fact that they are never alone.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>The reasons for my life are in a million faces</u><br>My life is full of endless possibilities and potential, and it is embodied in the countless people who have touched and inspired me.</p><br><p><u>Like aching promises I feel them in my bones</u><br>The reasons for my life are deeply ingrained in my soul and are as unbreakable as the most solemn vows.</p><br><p><u>Slipping through my fingers to dance upon the road</u><br>Despite my best efforts to grasp onto them, the reasons for my life seem to dance and elude my complete understanding.</p><br><p><u>The reasons for my life are more than I can hold</u><br>The reasons I exist, the experiences and possibilities that shape me, are far more numerous and immense than I could ever imagine.</p><br><p><u>But oh, the sweet delight to sing with all my might</u><br>Despite the mystery and weight of the reasons for my life, I take joy in fully embracing and expressing myself through song.</p><br><p><u>To spark the inner light of wonder burning bright</u><br>Through my music, I aim to ignite a sense of awe and curiosity in myself and others, kindling a bright flame within.</p><br><p><u>You're not alone</u><br>I want to convey that, no matter how difficult or uncertain life may seem, we are all connected and share in this cosmic journey together.</p><br><p><u>The reasons for my life are buried in deep places</u><br>The true reasons for my existence are often obscured and can only be found through seeking them out and delving into the depths of my being.</p><br><p><u>Words once could awaken them</u><br>In the past, other people's words and ideas have helped me to see and understand my own purpose in life, unlocking the buried reasons within me.</p><br><p><u>These seeds that I have sown</u><br>Through trial and effort, I have planted the seeds of my own destiny, cultivating a life that is meaningful and fulfilling.</p><br><p><u>Ringing through the madness to crash against the cold</u><br>In the midst of chaos and adversity, the reasons for my life persist and ring out loud, even as they clash against the cold, hard reality of life.</p><br><p><u>The reasons for my life cannot be bought or sold</u><br>No amount of money or external influence can change the fundamental reasons for my existence, which are unique and personal to me.</p><br><p><u>The reasons for my life are filling all my spaces</u><br>Every aspect of my life is suffused with a sense of purpose and direction, as I strive to live authentically and fully embody my reasons for existing.</p><br><p><u>Like rushing waters flow, they carry me along</u><br>The reasons for my existence are like a powerful river, carrying me forward on an unstoppable journey towards my true destiny.</p><br><p><u>Twisting through my memory to pull free from the load</u><br>Sometimes the reasons for my life emerge through memory and reflection, helping me to break free from the burdens and challenges of the past.</p><br><p><u>The reasons for my life are more than I was told</u><br>Despite what others might say or believe about me, the true reasons for my existence are far more complex and profound than anyone could ever fully understand.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © MUSIC SALES CORPORATION<br>Written by: Minnie Riperton, Richard Rudolph</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIqZpbKzwM6nloahnqO2pnuxnpisp56o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
