However, things changed and now they are in it for the long haul. Fans even suspect that the pair might be engaged after spotting Woods wearing a massive diamond ring.</p><p>Published on March 26, 2021</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_44><a href=#>Jordyn Woods’s</a> fame has soared in the past several years. Though many people knew Woods because of her close friendship with <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>, after falling out with the Kardashian-Jenners in 2019, the model has focused on her career and made a name for herself.</p><p id=par-2_36>Now, the 23-year-old is in a loving romance with NBA star Karl-Anthony Towns. The pair went public with their relationship in Sept. 2020 and have continued to share glimpses of their relationships with their fans.</p><p id=par-3_27>Now, fans have gotten wind of a massive diamond on Woods’ ring finger, and they are convinced that she and Towns are headed down the aisle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jordyn-Woods-1.jpg><h2 id=h-jordyn-woods-and-karl-anthony-towns-were-friends-for-years-before-getting-romantic>Jordyn Woods and Karl-Anthony Towns were friends for years before getting romantic</h2><p id=par-4_80>Long before they were linked romantically, Woods and Towns were seen hanging out together as friends. In fact, the businesswoman said she never even thought of the NBA player as a potential partner because they had such a deep friendship. In a past Instagram comment, Woods even referred to Towns as &nbsp;“like a brother,” However, that all changed when Towns’ mother died due to complications from COVID-19, and their pair grew very close. Woods also experienced losing a parent.</p><p id=par-5_36>“Life is very funny sometimes and very unforgiving sometimes, especially this year and not just for one group but for everyone,” Woods told &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HollywoodLife</a>. “Definitely a weird time, but it’s nice that this is working out.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-karl-anthony-towns-has-hinted-at-marrying-jordyn-woods>Karl-Anthony Towns has hinted at marrying Jordyn Woods</h2><p id=par-6_47>With such a solid foundation in their friendship, it appears that the young couple might be ready to take the next step. In early March 2021, the couple shut down some weird trolls that had used photoshopped images to convince fans Towns was cheating on Woods.</p><p id=par-7_19>The NBA star immediately clapped back, hinting that he wanted the eyelash guru to be his wife someday. &nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_44>“So I got the baddest girl in the game and you think I’m gonna waste my energy with anyone else gtfoh!” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>. “Same haters we got now are gonna be the same ones we have when I put that ring on her finger.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 id=h-are-jordyn-woods-and-karl-anthony-towns-engaged>Are Jordyn Woods and Karl-Anthony Towns engaged?</h2><p id=par-9_44>It appears that Towns was serious about putting that ring on Woods’ finger. In a March 25 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post, the actor shared a snap of herself standing in front of an Air Jordan statue and wearing a massive diamond ring on *that* finger.</p><p id=par-10_46>“Heir jordyn with a giant air jordan,”&nbsp;Woods wrote in the caption, but all fans could focus on was the giant emerald cut ring on her hand. “Ummm is that an&nbsp;engagement ring?!!?!,” one fan demanded to know, while another commented, “Wait…… jordyn pleaseeeeeee tell me ur engageddddd!!!!!!”</p><p id=par-11_13>Towns even commented on the photo saying, “Knew I was missing a shoe….”</p><p id=par-12_36>If the duo is engaged, they are keeping it under wraps for now. If they aren’t, it looks like Woods has some pretty stunning jewelry to show off, and who can be mad about that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sL7DsqVmr5%2BksbR5ypqppWWRo8Gpu82yZK2np6PAbrHNoJignZRjtbW5y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
