The 22 year-old attended the reputable&nbsp;Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles,&nbsp;despite being known for their demanding admission process.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Prince himself faced some&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">backlash back in June</a> when he appeared on Instagram to post a video of him defending his late grandfather's name against haters accusing him of abusing his sons, and Prince's father. "Y'all&nbsp;can keep talking all the shit you want saying he abused my dad and all this," he says in the video. "But he raised these kids right, otherwise they would have been in gangs or fucking dead."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Numerous family members, including TJ Jackson,&nbsp;the surrogate father to all of Michael's children, attended the prestigious event to congratulate the youngster.&nbsp;“Prince, it’s been a long road but you did it,” he tweets. “Keep learning, keep growing and keep giving back! So so proud of you.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Perhaps the most notable attendee though was Prince’s 17-year-old brother, and youngest of the sons, Blanket.&nbsp;Despite the fact that his siblings often make public appearances, Blanket has rarely been seen in public since his father died back in 200 (To fans, perhaps his&nbsp;most memorable moment was when, at just 9-months-old,&nbsp;he was held over the railing of a balcony by his dad.) It wasn't too surprising he showed up though since it's pretty normal to expect he would support his brother for such an accomplishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honestly I can't tell you if all of it was worth it yet but I am proud of my degree as I believe it is a testament to my dedication and discipline. I'm thankful for LMUs education of a whole person and the implementation of Jesuit values because I believe they inspire graduates like me to continue to change the world for the better." Prince captions his Instagram photo with his brother. We're sure his father would be proud.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhboZygZJmpKKbmJayrXnJmpqkq5%2BjwG6%2Fzqdkm6SRo7imwIymmKSdo2K%2For7EZpipqJWWv6K6wp5koqZdqMKxvM6rq2anlmKvs7vToZyrZaCntq%2BvxKxkoKqRmcKiwMiopWamlazA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
