Thus, the creative team is obliged to at least toss around an idea for a post-credits scene and film something that’s inconsequential to the plot just in case the mood strikes in post.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>Unlike the film’s many monsters and mobsters, that mood did not strike; there’s no mid or post-credits scene to be found in Renfield. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not worth sticking around for a bit once the credits start rolling.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Plenty of moviegoers know the pattern by now; the first wave of credits on a movie, especially genre fiction movies, are usually done in a stylish manner that honors the aesthetic of the film. This is true for Renfield.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>But what makes Renfield stand out is that even its second wave of credits, the ones that are usually just a black screen with plain, scrolling text, is stylized in a way that catches the eye just as much as the first wave, complete with a heavy film grain, black-and-white stills of the cast, and radioactive-green colored text.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>It’s a fun little bit of extra effort that some viewers may appreciate catching, so while there’s no mid or post-credits scenes in Renfield, the credits themselves are interesting enough to at least warrant a quick glimpse at them.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false>Renfield is now playing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2K%2FprrFopylnF2drrexjJpkqaejqXqkvsSdoK2rXaiwprrEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
