It is a<strong> no-bake chocolate dessert</strong> that is so rich and decadent, you will have all of the chocolate lovers in your life begging for the recipe!</p><p>Indulging in a rich and velvety chocolate pot de crème is a culinary experience like no other. This classic French dessert, known for its silky texture and intense chocolate flavor, is surprisingly simple to make at home.</p><p>Since Valentine’s Day is around the corner, I wanted to share the most velvety smooth, rich chocolate dessert.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chocolate-Pot-de-Creme-26-720x721.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Chocolate Pot de Creme?</h2><p>Chocolate pot de crème, pronounced “poh-duh-KREHM,” is a classic French dessert that translates to “pot of cream” in English. This rich and velvety custard is known for its smooth texture and intense chocolate flavor. It is often served in small, individual pots or ramekins.</p><p>A chocolate pot de creme is basically a pot of chocolate cream or custard. This could even be considered a chocolate mousse.</p><p>The basic ingredients for chocolate pot de crème typically include high-quality dark chocolate, eggs, sugar, heavy cream, whole milk, and vanilla extract. The preparation involves melting the chocolate, whisking it into a mixture of eggs and sugar, and then incorporating the heavy cream, whole milk, and vanilla extract. The resulting custard is then baked in a water bath until set.</p><p>The water bath helps to ensure gentle and even cooking, preventing the custard from curdling or cracking. Once baked, the chocolate pot de crème is chilled until it reaches a creamy, pudding-like consistency.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chocolate-Pot-de-Creme-51-720x628.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chocolate pot de creme Ingredients:</h2><ul><li><strong>Semi-sweet chocolate</strong>: This is where most of the flavor is coming from, so you want to use good quality chocolate. Milk chocolate would be too sweet with the sugar and cream, so I recommend a semi-sweet chocolate. I’ve listed more of what chocolate I recommend below.</li><li><strong>Heavy cream and half and half or whole milk</strong>: The key to achieving that luscious texture is using heavy cream. It adds richness and a luxurious mouthfeel to the dessert. When heated, it will thicken up to the consistency of pot de creme.</li><li><strong>Egg yolks</strong>: The egg yolks are what give the pots de creme its texture. It makes the custard rich, thick, and moist.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong>: The sugar is what helps make this recipe a decadent dessert instead of a more bitter pudding. It also traps moisture and gets the best texture!</li><li><strong>Salt and vanilla</strong>: Both salt and vanilla help to amplify the flavors of the pot de creme.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chocolate-Pot-de-Creme-27-720x879.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make Chocolate Pot de Creme:</h2><li><strong>Start with a heavy-bottomed saucepan</strong>.&nbsp; Add heavy cream, half-n-half, egg yolks, sugar, and salt.&nbsp; Cook until it begins to thicken and will coat the back of a spoon. It is important to continually stir the mixture so it doesn’t burn or become clumpy. I like to use a whisk so I get an extra smooth custard.</li><li><strong>Remove from heat and add the chopped chocolate</strong>. The reason the chocolate is chopped into small pieces is that it helps it to melt easier and incorporate into the custard.&nbsp; I also prefer to use a semi-sweet chocolate bar instead of chips.&nbsp; Add vanilla.</li><li><strong>Divide chocolate custard into ramekins or glass jars</strong>. I find that a little goes a long way here! This is a very rich dessert so I make small portions.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chocolate-Pot-de-Creme-23-crop-720x753.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What type of chocolate should I use when making Chocolate Pot de Creme?</h2><p>Since chocolate is the star of the show, I always suggest to use the highest-quality chocolate your budget will allow to buy. You can use either dark or semi-sweet chocolate depending on how sweet you want your chocolate custard. I use semi-sweet chocolate bars and chopped them into fine pieces so they easily melt.</p><p>High-quality chocolate (I like to use semi-sweet chocolate bars such as Trader Joe’s Pound Plus Bar) is added to the warm custard and it naturally melts into the cream mixture. It is chilled in the refrigerator until set and then topped with fresh whipped cream to lighten it up a bit. I always love to serve it with fresh raspberries or strawberries since they pair beautifully with chocolate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Storage:</h2><p>Store your chocolate pot de crème in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in airtight containers, for up to 3-4 days. Before serving leftovers, let them come to room temperature for the best texture and flavor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Substitutions and Variations:</h2><li><strong>Dark Chocolate or</strong> <strong>Milk Chocolate:</strong> Experiment with different types of chocolate from semi-sweet to dark to milk chocolate for a sweeter, milder flavor.</li><li><strong>Flavored Infusions:</strong> Infuse the cream with spices like cinnamon, cardamom, or a hint of espresso for unique flavor profiles.</li><li><strong>Nutty Additions:</strong> Introduce chopped nuts such as hazelnuts or almonds for added texture and flavor.</li><li><strong>Fresh Fruit</strong>: Top with fresh fruit such as raspberries or strawberries to add some fresh tartness to balance out the richness of the chocolate.</li><p>Chocolate pot de crème is often served chilled and can be garnished with a variety of toppings, such as whipped cream, berries, or a sprinkle of cocoa powder. Its luxurious texture and deep chocolate flavor make it a favorite among dessert enthusiasts and chocolate lovers.</p><p>I have always been a Valentine’s Day lover.
