Kylee said:</p><p>‚ÄúFollowing our relationship announcement yesterday, I want to thank my God he did not allow me to live another day in the dark. In the last 24 hoursm I have been grasping with the fact that one of the most important relationships in my life has dissolved due to multiple infidelities. This is not just a show but my real life, and for the foreseeable future I will be in a time of healing and trying to put the puzzle pieces of my life back together. Please respect my privacy at this time. Love you all.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false>Aven owned up to his actions, apologizing to Kylee in a statement of his own:</p><p>After careful thought and consideration into writing this, I want to first and foremost apologize to Kylee, my family, and my friends for my actions. I have made major mistakes in the relationship and hurt someone who was very close to me. At this time, I am in an extremely extremely low place trying to work on myself. I am doing my best to find healing, find myself, and be a better person. Please have grace and respect for Kylee and her family through this difficult time.

We were so excited about posting the pictures‚Ä¶ I had an hour of bliss, and I decided to hurt my own feelings by checking my hidden requests. It said, ‚ÄòHey girl.

It was like a friend of a friend‚Äôs roommate. I began messaging back and forth with her‚Ä¶ I said, ‚ÄòDo you have any like full blown evidence?‚Äô And she was like, ‚ÄòYes, I have a picture of him in her bed the next morning.‚Äô That‚Äôs when my heart sank, and I was having an out of body experience, because I‚Äôm like, I never saw this coming ever in my life.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Concluding by saying that ‚Äúthe proof had slapped [her] in the face,‚Äù Kylee and Aven called it quits shortly after she had seen the picture, and we could not be prouder of the Bachelor Nation beauty for standing up for herself.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=false>While it might not have had a happy ending, fans of The Bachelor can watch Kylee Russell‚Äôs journey on season 9 of Bachelor In Paradise via Hulu.
