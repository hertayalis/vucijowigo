Taylor later raved about the inking, calling it "the coolest thing ever".Last year, Ed said couldn't see romance on the cards for him and Taylor. "We had great fun when we met, but I don't think I'm Taylor's type," he said. "If you look at all the dudes she's dated, they're all tall, brown hair, brown eyes, very attractive and all the girls scream for them. I'm chubby, ginger with blue eyes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6416d0ea0746-taylor-swift1-z.jpg><p id=eK-KKMHnXMen data-wc=70>Nevertheless, Taylor has previously described Ed as "one of my favorite human beings on the planet"."Taylor made it clear when they go off on tour she wants Ed to be her boyfriend," a source told the <i>Sun</i>."He's thrilled as he has always thought she's amazing. When they split last year he always hoped they would get back together. They've vowed not to have a nasty break-up, no matter that happens."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
