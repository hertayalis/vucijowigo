If you want something you've never experienced before to happen in 2019, I've got 15 <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>poems about new beginnings</a> to help you ring in the new year with intention.</p><p>If you're like me, you find yourself screaming <a href=# class=T3D>"NEW YEAR, NEW ME,"</a> like, every year, whether you actually make a radical change in your life or not. It's understandable, however, if <a href=# class=T3D>not keeping your last few New Year's resolutions</a> has got you down in the dumps. But not keeping a New Year's resolution is A-OK! No one's perfect, and <a href=# class=T3D>wanting to change yourself for the better</a> is an admirable resolution to make, even if you don't manage to fully achieve it.</p><p>Anyone who feels anxious at the thought of making — and possibly breaking — yet another New Year's resolution needs to read the 15 poems about new beginnings that I've selected below. These poets' words will inspire you to embrace the unlimited possibilities that the next year will bring —&nbsp;no matter how it all ends.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"The birthday of the world" by Marge Piercy</h2></p><p>"On the birthday of the world</p><p>I begin to contemplate</p><p>what I have done and left</p><p>undone, but this year</p><p>not so much rebuilding"</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Read the poem in full here.</a></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"The Origin of Birds" by Nicole Callihan</h2></p><p>"For hours, the flowers were enough.</p><p>Before the flowers, Adam had been enough.</p><p>Before Adam, just being a rib was enough.</p><p>Just being inside Adam’s body, near his heart, enough."</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Read the poem in full here.</a></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Burning the Old Year" by Naomi Shihab Nye</h2></p><p>"Letters swallow themselves in seconds.</p><p>Notes friends tied to the doorknob,</p><p>transparent scarlet paper,</p><p>sizzle like moth wings,</p><p>marry the air."</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Read the poem in full here.</a></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Blossom" by Dorianne Laux</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"A Pumpkin at New Year's" by Sandra McPherson</h2></p><p>"Heads were rolling down the highway in high slat trucks.</p><p>I knew it was time to buy you and found you,</p><p>The last sphere unscarred and undistorted in the store,</p><p>Big as my own head."</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Read the poem in full here.</a></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Up-Hill" by Christina Rossetti</h2></p><p>"Does the road wind up-hill all the way?</p><p>Yes, to the very end.</p><p>Will the day’s journey take the whole long day?</p><p>From morn to night, my friend."</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Read the poem in full here.</a></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Resolution" by Lia Purpura</h2></p><p>"There’s the thing I shouldn’t do</p><p>and yet, and now I have</p><p>the rest of the day to</p><p>make up for, not</p><p>undo, that can’t be done"</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer>Read the poem in full here.</a></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Ephemeral Stream" by Elizabeth Willis</h2></p><p>"This is the way water</p><p>thinks about the desert.</p><p>The way the thought of water</p><p>gives you something</p><p>to stumble on.
