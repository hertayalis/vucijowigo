On an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show (via <a href=#>HuffPost</a>) in 2012, he told the talk show host that he'd just graduated from high school. He was 13 years old.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>For perspective, at a time when most kids are graduating from eighth grade and grabbling with the awkwardness of those years, Gould was a high school graduate preparing to take college courses, and he was on a hit television show.</p><p dir=ltr>Gould is actually a genius with an IQ of 150 and a member of <a href=#>Mensa</a>, a society for people with high IQs, per <a href=#>Bustle</a>. For what it's worth, Gould has a pretty good handle on how good he has it. He told DeGeneres, "As I'm driving in my limo, I'm like, 'Wait a second, I'm 13, this is my third time at the Emmys.' It's like, what am I supposed to do with the rest of my life? It's kind of all downhill from now." He's accomplished more in 22 years than many people do in their whole lives!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1ia4N5e82oo5qmXZy8trjDZqCsZZ2qsKl50qaYq6yVp3q1tMCnZKGho2K6sLDEq6VmnpGitq3FjJyfmqqRmMGmvo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
