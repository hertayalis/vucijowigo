(Real talk, that resemblance is the definition of uncanny.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But did you know that there are more family branches, and that those branches extend as far as the Simpson sisters? Yes, Ashlee and Jessica are also part of the fam.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At Sunday night's Grammy Awards, however, where Diana was honored on her 75th birthday, all eyes were on her 9-year-old grandson Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick. The fourth grader had the honor of introducing his grandma, and the world was instantly charmed.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And there's more where that came from. Here's a run down of every other branch of the family tree:</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First things first, an ode to the supreme matriarch: Diana. The singer, actress and producer extraordinaire is the former leading lady of the hottest girl groups in Motown (and history), the Supremes. After leaving the group in 1970, she launched a solo career with hits such as "Ain't No Mountain High Enough," which you may have heard just once or twice. She has released 24 (!) studio albums and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Though the 12-time Grammy-nominated songstress never took home the top prize, she was awarded a lifetime achievement award in 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she wasn't busy churning out the hits, she had a bit of time for romance. She became involved with Motown CEO Berry Gordy in 1965, and became pregnant with her first child, Rhonda Suzanne Silberstein in 1971; however, 2 months into her pregnancy she married Robert Ellis Silberstein. Rhonda is mother to Raif.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple went on to have two more daughters, Tracee (the aforementioned actress) and Chudney (an author), each of whom caught the entertainment bug like their older sister, who pursued music. Diana and Robert divorced in 1977.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diana wed her second husband, a Norwegian shipping magnate named Arne Næss Jr., in 1986 after dating for a year. The couple had two sons together: Ross and Evan. Næss and Diana divorced in 2000.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So where, you might ask, do the Simpsons come into play? Well, Diana's youngest, 30-year-old Evan, is married to Ashlee Simpson, meaning that technically, she's Diana's daughter-in-law. Evan and Ashlee recently debuted both a record together and a new reality show on E! called (fittingly), Ashlee + Evan.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ross has 5 grandbabies, making for quite the photo opp:</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Granitz/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We can only imagine family reunions at the Ross household (does Jess and her fam get an invite, too?
