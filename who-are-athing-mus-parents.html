In doing so, she shattered a national record previously set by Ajeé Wilson in 2017, and also established a new continental under-20 record. Additionally, Mu secured her second gold medal as a vital part of the women’s 4 × 400m relay team.</p><p>Her dominance continued as she emerged as the 800m World Champion in 2022, making history once more by becoming the first American woman to claim this prestigious title in the discipline. Mu’s achievements have solidified her as a trailblazer in the sport, and she holds the record for the longest reign as the AEW Women’s World Champion, an astonishing 372 days during her first tenure.</p><p>Mu’s prowess isn’t confined to outdoor events. She holds the world under-20 record for the women’s indoor 800 meters, a feat she achieved in early 2021. In addition, she boasts the world U20 best in the indoor 600 meters, a remarkable accomplishment she attained at the age of 16 in 2019. Her indoor performances place her among the top three fastest indoor runners in history.</p><p>Her journey to records and achievements didn’t stop there. On February 24, 2019, Mu made headlines by breaking the American women’s record in the 600-meter event during the 2019 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships, recording a remarkable time of 1:23.57. Her incredible performance not only bested the previous American women’s record but also came tantalizingly close to the women’s world record, held by Olga Kotlyarova.</p><p>In 2021, <a href=# rel=noopener>Athing Mu</a> continued her remarkable run by setting an indoor collegiate and world under-20 record in the 800 meters with a time of 1:58.40. She further solidified her status by setting the USA collegiate record for the 800 meters with a time of 1:57.73 in an outdoor event in Waco, Texas. At the 2021 NCAA Championships, she lowered her collegiate all-time record to 49.57 seconds in the 400 meters, achieving victory before anchoring the Texas A&M Women’s 4 × 400m relay team to triumph and a new collegiate record of 3:22.34.</p><p>Athing Mu’s journey led her to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where she showcased her exceptional talent by winning two gold medals in the women’s 800 meters and the women’s 4 × 400m relay. In the 800 meters, she displayed a dominant performance, breaking the American women’s 800m record with a remarkable time of 1:55.21, ending a 53-year Olympic win drought for the USA in this event. Her accomplishments at the Olympics earned her the title of the youngest U.S. woman to win an individual Olympic track and field event since Wyomia Tyus achieved the feat in 1964.</p><p>In her first post-Olympic race at the Prefontaine Classic, Mu demonstrated her prowess by setting an even better American 800m record of one minute 55.04 seconds. Despite running unchallenged over the final lap, her performance also established an all-comers’ record and solidified her as the second-fastest U20 woman in history, following in the footsteps of Pamela Jelimo. This remarkable achievement placed her eighth on the world all-time list.</p><p>Athing Mu’s record-breaking season included 36 competitions (including rounds), with her securing victory in 35 of them. Her exceptional performance led to her being named the World Athletics Female Rising Star of the Year.</p><p>At the World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, Athing Mu faced tough competition but managed to narrowly clinch the women’s 800 meters gold with a world-leading time of 1:56.30. Her victory, by a margin of just 0.08 seconds, made her the first American woman to attain the 800m world championship title. Mu’s win streak extended to nearly three years, as she had not suffered an outdoor race loss since September 2019. Her achievements have solidified her legacy as the youngest woman in history to hold Olympic and world titles in an individual track and field event.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Athing Mu’s Parents?</h2><p>Athing Mu hails from Trenton, New Jersey, where she spent her formative years.
