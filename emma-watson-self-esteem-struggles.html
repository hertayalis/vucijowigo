As most of us can attest, insecurities, body image issues and crippling self-doubt are par for the course as a teenager and young adult—add to that a spotlight on your every move and it becomes clear why even Emma Watson was not immune to the anxieties of adolescence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a recent interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/news/a9624/esquire-meets-emma-watson/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Esquire UK" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Esquire UK</a>, the actress and activist opened up about the lapse in confidence that she experienced in her early twenties:&nbsp;</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I, as a 21-year-old, was riddled with insecurity and self-critiquing. Some of my friends still are. I realized that I didn't like friends taking photos of me when I wasn't working and I actually got in a fight about this issue. And I wondered, why is this bothering me? Why does this make me&nbsp;so insecure? And I realized it's because I&nbsp;can't even reconcile myself with&nbsp;my own image on the front of these magazines.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Comparing myself to how I&nbsp;look, when I've gone through all of that makeup and styling, in my normal life is… just… I can't live up to it. I was like, 'Holy shit! If that's how I feel — and I&nbsp;get&nbsp;to be the person who's on the cover of&nbsp;those magazines — how's anyone else meant to cope?'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watson goes on to explain that familiar transition that happens as you get older and learn to accept and love yourself as your are:&nbsp;</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's unbelievable. Switching from that to&nbsp;being like: 'Oh, I actually operate in a&nbsp;system that's fucked. I'm not fucked, the system's fucked. OK.' And, ironically, it's probably made me more beautiful and more confident as a result because I'm not carrying that anxiety any more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you needed another reason to admire her, this should do the trick.&nbsp;</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/90c7be36-7ec0-48af-bc29-cd00991f9c44.jpg alt="Headshot of Sarah Lindig" title="Headshot of Sarah Lindig" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sarah Lindig is the senior digital editor, overseeing special projects for Harper's Bazaar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaaWRrfnd7xKakmmWnlsG0u81mqp6klmKytMDEnqRmq6Snwqizy56qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
