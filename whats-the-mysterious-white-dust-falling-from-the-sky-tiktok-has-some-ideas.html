Whenever a news story goes viral on the site, you can expect users to have some interesting takes. Right now, this phenomenon is on full display as&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;users try to deduce why white dust is falling from the sky.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-what-is-the-mysterious-white-dust data-injectable=false>What is the mysterious white dust?&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>On Feb. 23, people living in Maryland and West Virginia reported that specks of mysterious white dust were falling from the sky, covering their cars and streets.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Talking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hill,</a>&nbsp;Sherry Miller, a local resident, said:</p><p>“We had no idea what it was. It looked like ash. I asked my husband if it was from the wood stove and he said, ‘No, it’s all over Berkeley County.’</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>Quickly, the local government jumped into action with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), collecting dust samples to test. While Berkeley County Office of Emergency Management made it clear that they had received no reports of ill health linked to the mysterious dust.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Within a few days, the WVDEP gave a surprisingly mundane answer, saying that the dust was “pollen, with trace amounts of mineral matter.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>UPDATE – Feb. 27, 2023: Final results from the dust samples collected Friday indicate the material is predominantly pollen, with trace amounts of mineral matter.</p><p>The samples were analyzed by WVU's Dept. of Geology and Geography and WVU's Shared Research Facility. <a href=#>https://t.co/Wy61b2zbzF</a></p>— WV Dept. of Environmental Protection (@DEPWV) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><h2 id=h-what-did-tiktok-think-it-was data-injectable=false>What did TikTok think it was?</h2><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Of course, TikTok quickly became packed with videos of the strange dust, and the comment sections soon filled up with discussion. Many users threw out their own theories about its origins and true purpose.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true><a title=@stevensaysstuff href=#>@stevensaysstuff</a><p><a title=greenscreenvideo href=#>#greenscreenvideo</a> <a title=westvirginia href=#>#westvirginia</a> <a title=maryland href=#>#maryland</a></p><a title="♬ Suspense, horror, piano and music box - takaya" href=#>♬ Suspense, horror, piano and music box – takaya</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@oglifestyle.two href=#>@oglifestyle.two</a><p>🚨<a title=breaking href=#>#BREAKING</a> Multiple reports of unknown White dust / Particles falling out of the sky 📌<a title=westvirginia href=#>#WestVirginia</a> | <a title=maryland href=#>#Maryland</a> Currently Multiple people across West Virginia into Maryland area are reporting a (unknown white dust/film descending from the sky.

This theory echoes a statement made by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC News Now</a>&nbsp;Meteorologist Damon Matson. When asked about the dust he said:&nbsp;</p><p>“This is likely dust from the desert southwest, a very strong storm system causing all the wintry weather across the northern U.S. and severe weather in the southern U.S. It picked up the dust on the back side of the storm and dragged it across the country. The dust remained elevated in the atmosphere as the storm remained strong.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Another theory suggested that it was ashes from a local wildfire, with one comment noting, “That looks like ashes from a huge fire…might have blown their way…I know wildfires bring ashes from afar.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Other users argued it was, “The white stuff that they put out big fires,” with many wondering if it might have been used on the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and blown across.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Of course, many users decided to revive a classic conspiracy theory and alleged that the dust was dropped by planes. One user posted that: “I live in ohio we have been having lots of jets leaving chem trails!! we have pics.” While another said:</p><p>“My friend in Maryland saw a small plane dropping white dust this morning. Something weird’s going on.”</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Some believed the dust storm was the latest and greatest marketing stunt ever, arguing that the team behind&nbsp;Cocaine Bear&nbsp;was dropping white powder to get people interested in the film. One comment summed this up by saying:</p><p>“That one movie really want to advertise it.”</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>However, the most common reply suggested that the dust was snow, and the locals were unfamiliar with the wintery concept. One user succinctly and hilariously posted:</p><p>“Bro just discovered snow.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArapmrJiaeq7F0q2cq6GfqsBuw8eiq55llKrAtXnFmqOloZ6ceqe%2BzqZkraCVYsCsxYytoKSsn6B6qa3SZqqopZVitqWxwKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
