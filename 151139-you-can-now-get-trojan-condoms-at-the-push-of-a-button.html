Then the brand new <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Trojan Dash Button</a> is the invention of your dreams, my friend. Launching Thursday, March 31, just in time for <a href=# class=T3D>National STI Awareness Month</a> in April, this new button gives you no excuse to not be fully stocked at all times. Amazon Prime members who press this button (and I don't know why they wouldn't all the time, it's a cool button) will receive condoms at their door within two days.</p><p>You may think it's a long time if you're in the moment and neither one of you has a condom, which is the exact situation nearly <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>one in five adults have been in the last time they had unprotected sex</a>, but it sounds like this handy button is better suited for stocking up when your supply is running low. If you need one ASAP, you may have to actually get off your butt and go downstairs to a convenience store and get one (gasp) yourself. This button is just teaching us to be be smarter, safer adults — with fun little toy, of course. It's <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>$4.99 and you can buy it on Amazon</a>.</p><p>"Throughout the brand's 100 year history, Trojan has always been a leader and innovator in sexual health," Bruce Weiss, Vice President of Marketing for Trojan Brand Condoms said in a press release. "We're excited to work with Amazon to deliver Trojan condoms right to our consumer's door with the push of a button. The Amazon Dash Button for Trojan further ensures our consumers are always prepared."</p><p>But Trojan isn't the only company on the on-demand condom game. Here are some other options:</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>L. Condoms</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>If you live in San Francisco, Manhattan, or Brooklyn, you can get a box of 12 eco-friendly, socially responsible, and high quality condoms <a href=# class=T3D>delivered right to your door in under an hou</a>r — at any hour — via bike messenger for $15. After photojournalist Talia Frenkel was sent to Africa to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>document women dying of HIV/AIDS</a>, she was inspired to start her company, which distributes a condom in a developing country for every condom purchased.</p><h3>2. 7-Eleven Date Night Pack</h3><p>Want a little ice cream with your protection?
