The upcoming film is <a href=#>inspired by the true story</a> of an American black bear that ingested a duffel bag full of cocaine in 1985, but unlike its film counterpart, the real "Cocaine Bear" did not kill anyone.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the film, Alden plays Eddie Dentwood, the son of drug cartel leader Syd Dentwood (played by the late great <a href=#>Ray Liotta</a> in one of his final performances). Now, as we all prepare to flock to our local movie theaters to bask in the cinematic masterpiece that is Cocaine Bear, fans can't help but be curious to learn more about Alden, specifically his love life.</p><p>On that note, <a href=#>who is Alden Ehrenreich dating</a>?

However, in a 2013 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, he was asked what his relationship status was and he replied, "No comment," while seemingly "smiling mysteriously."</p><p>At the time, Alden was rumored to be dating actress and writer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelsey McNamee</a>. Many believe the pair is still together to this day; however, it's hard to determine if they are or were ever in a relationship since neither party has confirmed or mentioned anything about their supposed association.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>During the same interview with Elle, the Los Angeles native discussed love and whether he believes in destined romances.</p><p>"I feel about romance the same way I do about a vocation; it's a calling," Alden told the outlet. "You have an inner intuition, an inner 'yes.' I don't know if it's destined or not, but certainly I couldn't imagine being the person I am today without the romantic experiences I've had." Wow, talk about one swoon-worthy man.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alden Ehrenreich has an impressive upcoming slate of projects.</h2><p>Besides the sure-to-be smash hit Cocaine Bear, Alden has an impressive upcoming slate of projects that includes Christopher Nolan's biographical film Oppenheimer, Chloe Domont's critically acclaimed erotic thriller Fair Play, and the <a href=#>Disney Plus</a> series <a href=#>Ironheart</a>, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.</p><p>In conversation with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the actor discussed the latter project and how his newfound friendship with Iron Man himself, Mr. Robert Downey Jr., eased his nerves about joining another wildly popular franchise.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>we are entering the alden ehrenreich renaissance i am going absolutely insane girlies</p>— redd :) (@reddthefett) <a href=#>January 20, 2023</a></figure><p>"All of my [Oppenheimer] scenes are with Robert Downey Jr., and we developed a really nice friendship. And then when Ironheart happened right after, I got to call him and talk to him about it before I started," Alden said. He delved further, revealing that right before he boarded Ironheart, he was worried RDJ would tell him not to sign on.</p><p>"But Downey didn't say that, and I sort of had the honor of introducing [Downey Jr. and Thorne]. They didn't know each other and hadn't talked yet, so I put them in contact with each other. He is so unf--kingbelievably generous and sweet and giving with his time, and he was so happy to talk to her and encourage her. So that was really nice."</p><p>Cocaine Bear hits theaters on Friday, Feb. 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmlsc1mnKGqlaO%2FprXCoWSdmaSeu6g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
