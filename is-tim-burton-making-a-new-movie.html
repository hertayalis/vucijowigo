The spin-off series that focuses on Jenna Ortega’s Wednesday Addams from The Addams Family proved to be a hit with critics and fans alike, marking a minor career renaissance for Burton.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>You see, by changing the scale of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">director’s scope</a>&nbsp;to that of the small screen,&nbsp;Wednesday&nbsp;has managed to win audiences all over again following recent Burton-associated projects that were considered disappointments, such as the live-action&nbsp;Dumbo&nbsp;remake and&nbsp;Alice Through the Looking Glass&nbsp;(for which he served as producer).

As Burton explained in a recent interview (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>):</p><p>“I do enjoy all the people I’ve worked with. On this last one, Beetlejuice 2, I really enjoyed it […] I tried to strip everything and go back to the basics of working with good people and actors and puppets. It was kind of like going back to why I liked making movies.”</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>The sequel will reunite some of the cast as well, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Keaton</a> returning as Beetlejuice.
