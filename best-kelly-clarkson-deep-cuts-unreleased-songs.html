After all, when you kick off your career singing&nbsp;Burt Bacharach one night and Badfinger the next, the capacity to adapt becomes second nature.</p><p>By the end of 2017, Kelly Clarkson as we know her&nbsp;will have likely changed — but&nbsp;to understand where she's going,&nbsp;we've gotta remember&nbsp;where she's been. Below, we've strung together her 10 best deep cuts that placate, enrage and, above all else, entertain. Check 'em out, tell us what we missed and sound off on your hopes for KC8 in the comments.</p><p>(And before you all shout out in in protest, please remember that, yes, "Sober" was technically a single.)</p><ul><li><span class=count>10</span><h2>'Bad Reputation,' <i>Piece by Piece</i></h2><p>The horns-conducted song is on the precipice of cheesy, but there's massive redemption: "Bad Reputation" includes some of the most breathtaking and stratosphere-piercing studio vocals of Kelly's career. A bonus track standout from 2015's&nbsp;Piece by Piece,&nbsp;the song's sexy, bluesy and an audio assault, sending you tumbling head over feet just when you've managed to&nbsp;find your footing. That a track&nbsp;as good as this can be buried in an album (and land&nbsp;at No. 10 on this list) is simply proof of a solid&nbsp;artist's pedigree.</p></li><li><span class=count>9</span><h2>'Maybe,' <i>My December</i></h2><p>In case you weren't privy to the dissent and controversy surrounding&nbsp;the release of 2007's&nbsp;My December,&nbsp;which amounted to a battle between the eager-to-experiment Kelly and a stubborn, traditionalist RCA, allow "Maybe" to serve as&nbsp;your crash-course. It's as singer-songwriter as Kelly's ventured to get,&nbsp;and ignores pop convention while recklessly spitting&nbsp;out verses and callbacks, sometimes at seeming random. It's a bit slapdash, unclean and you'll think it's about to end about three times before it does, but you'll&nbsp;find something&nbsp;worth sticking around for.</p></li><li><span class=count>8</span><h2>'If No One Will Listen,' <i>All I Ever Wanted</i></h2><p>Even longtime Kelly fans might have forgotten about the&nbsp;All I Ever Wanted&nbsp;ballad, a remake of Keri Noble's 2004 origin track. But it's worth the revisit: "If No One Will Listen," the first song&nbsp;that features&nbsp;an exclusive Clarkson production credit,&nbsp;plays&nbsp;like her most prized possession, and mixes&nbsp;bits of shaky, untouched falsetto with bold, sweeping admonitions against self-harm. "If you find you've been settling for a world of gray / So you wouldn't have to face down your own hate" she gently supposes across&nbsp;some of the starkest and most sincere recording sessions of her career. All I Ever Wanted's&nbsp;"Whyyawannabringmedown" might be twice as loud, but this speaks miles more clearly.</p></li><li><span class=count>7</span><h2>'Some Kind of Miracle,' <i>Thankful</i></h2><p>Yes, it's tailor-made for stolen moments at sun-drenched&nbsp;weddings, but "Some Kind of Miracle" is more the first-dance benchmark than mere observer of the formula. The Diane Warren-penned track, straight from Clarkson's 2003 debut album, oozes sentiment, but not at the expense of its value or power — on&nbsp;Thankful,&nbsp;it shines, and if Kelly's indeed going soul with album No. 8, she'd be wise to remember this one.</p></li><li><span class=count>6</span><h2>'Hear Me,' <i>Breakaway</i></h2><p>In the 2004-ish era of Kelly-gone-rock, "Hear Me" hit hardest, pairing pretty piano-painted verses with relentless, speaker-busting chorus-wallops a la Amy Lee. Like sister track "Addicted," the&nbsp;Breakaway&nbsp;standout tested the limits of Kelly's shouty upper register, and the last 30 seconds will have you sure she's ready to split blood.</p></li><li><span class=count>5</span><h2>'Don't Let Me Stop You,' <i>All I Ever Wanted</i></h2><p>If ever there was an unreleased track in Kelly's catalog&nbsp;that begged&nbsp;to be a single, "Don't Let Me Stop You" maintains&nbsp;the distinction. With the help of&nbsp;Quiz & Larossi, the electric guitar-fueled tell-off soars, and sets free the same cleaned-up nerve and grit that made "Since U Been Gone" a radio cornerstone. Eclipsed by "Already Gone" as the the 2009 album's&nbsp;natural choice for third single, the song suffered for the era's you've-gotta-release-a-ballad-at-some-point reflex.</p></li><li><span class=count>4</span><h2>'You Love Me,' <i>Stronger</i></h2><p>Rarely is Kelly's voice the second best part of a song, but "You Love Me," a 2011 collaboration with Josh Abraham and Oliver Goldstein, is peak pop production. Sleek verses give way to punchy, quietly urgent chorus loops that demand&nbsp;attention without setting out to prove too much. Moreover, it's Kelly at her lyrical best, insisting that if you intend to condescend, you better hastily reconsider. "You Love Me" featured&nbsp;a superstar having finally relaxed and settled into her skill.</p></li><li><span class=count>3</span><h2>'The War Is Over,' <i>Stronger</i></h2><p>Early reports of pre-release Stronger listens included&nbsp;a trend among&nbsp;fans: crying upon hearing "The War Is Over" for the first time ("tears were rolling down my face," one magazine editor told <a href=#>The New York Times</a>).&nbsp;Easily the most cinematic song of Kelly's career, the Toby Gad-produced track&nbsp;is&nbsp;a slowly inching crescendo that&nbsp;swells in a way that demands the lump in your throat follows suit. It's a dismissal of that guy, those demons, these insecurities and&nbsp;any absolute&nbsp;or abstraction that the listener feels compelled to confront. Catharsis, thy name is&nbsp;pop-percussion cannonades.</p></li><li><span class=count>2</span><h2>'Why Don't You Try,' <i>Stronger</i></h2><p>Exclusive to Japanese markets and iTunes complete-album&nbsp;sales, "Why Don't You Try," a nearly scrapped 18th track written&nbsp;by Eric Hutchinson, is consummate Kelly Clarkson Soul before the official Kelly Clarkson soul album. On the otherwise '80s-leaning Stronger,&nbsp;the song is a standout for its timeless yearn. It burns. It broods. It paves a path for some of Kelly's best Kelly-wailing. It's just damn good.</p><p>Oh, and the last minute? Jesus.</p></li><li><span class=count>1</span><h2>'Chivas,' <i>My December</i></h2><p>Yes, buried in the back half of the final song on Clarkson's most forgotten&nbsp;album is her career's greatest triumph as a&nbsp;songwriter. "Chivas," a master class in coffee shop crooning, is soufflé-delicate, but as cutting as a pastry chef's precision cutter. Where power is concerned, it's about a tenth as loud as she can&nbsp;get, but somehow more arresting for its restraint&nbsp;— it's Simone Biles earning&nbsp;a Perfect 10 for the world's most faultless&nbsp;somersault. And, as far as booze&nbsp;metaphorizing goes, this one is tops — take it neat, dream&nbsp;along&nbsp;with&nbsp;the phonograph's static, and enjoy.</p><p><strong>10 Defining American Idol Season 1 Moments:</strong></p><p>[gallery galleryid="252:459121" galleryindex="0" ids="459230,459231,459224,459225,459226,459223,459234,459228,459232,459227" enablefullscreen="yes" showthumbs="no"]</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Tracks That Prove a Soul Album Is The Ticket for Kelly Clarkson</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kr6a%2F02ainqScrnqkuMCroqynnmKxprHPZpqurKNiwq%2B%2BxKWcmquVmXq0u82gqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
