Previous seasons of the show saw a major sexual scandal break out, which was undeniably reminiscent of the real life scandal of Matt Lauer's abrupt exit from the <a class=hm-link href=#>Today Show</a> under similar circumstances.</p><p id=e-_ThbwdRT data-wc=25>Shortly after the first season premiered, Jennifer <a class=hm-link href=#>acknowledged that shows</a> like the Today Show and <a class=hm-link href=#>Good Morning America</a> inspired her show and character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a9c3b479883f-jennifer-aniston-white-dog.jpg><p id=eHsB1Dml53 data-wc=56>However, they were keen to have differences with Jennifer confirming to&nbsp;Variety that the whole script was reworked "from scratch" following Matt's departure and the prominence of the #MeToo movement. Jennifer also revealed that she watched the Today Show episode from the day before Matt was fired, and wondered: "Did he know? Did he not know?"</p><p id=eiwR9aBcv5 data-wc=59>Speaking about the moment it happened, the actress shared: "I was so devastated. It's such a strange thing; it felt oddly like my dad did something terrible. I trusted him and had been interviewed by him. He was there for so many moments in my life. And when Friends was ending, it was Katie [Couric] and Matt interviewing us."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/49b7b5a3027a-jennifer-aniston-dolly.jpg><p id=eCqS2G7rOL data-wc=60>She added: "Mitch Kessler [Steve's character] is not based on him at all. He's just sort of the archetype of all of the men that he's representing." Jennifer nsaid the characters are "all fictional," although the character did highlight the "aspects of the archetype of a charming narcissist, of a generation of men that didn't think that was bad behavior."</p><p id=e-NmG4CJw5 data-wc=10><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Who is Jennifer Aniston dating?
