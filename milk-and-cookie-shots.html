I always love to chill my dough to allow the flavors to develop and become an even richer cookie. If time is on your side, chill the cookie dough for 24-48 hours. You will want to chill the dough for a minimum of 30 minutes before baking.</li><li><strong>Once the dough in chilled, spray regular-sized muffin tins with non-stick cooking spray</strong>. Then you press the chilled cookie dough into the muffin tin, making an indention in the center and pressing the dough up the sides of the muffin tins to make a well.</li><li><strong>Bake them until the cookies are a light golden brown color and baked through</strong>. Spray a glass with non-stick cooking spray and press the glass into the center of the baked cookie to make a deeper well.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Milk-and-Cookie-Shots-6-scaled.jpg alt="Milk and Cookie Shots The famous Milk and Cookie Shots were made famous at New York City Dominique Ansel Bakery.
