In the span of only a few years, all of that has occurred. “He was a dynamic man,” said Gail Eaton, who had previously worked at the zoo as the vice president of marketing and communications under Maple.</p><p>“He knew what he wanted and he kept going until he got it.” Using a combination of his unwavering optimism and astute marketing skills, he utilised several resources, including the most well-known inhabitant of the zoo, gorilla Willie B., as well as the local media, in order to have the community support his goals. According to his friends and family,</p><p>Maple’s upbringing was saturated with a connection with animals, which sparked a desire that eventually lead him to earn a Ph.D. in psychobiology from the University of California-Davis and eventually landed him a position at Georgia Tech before he started working at the Atlanta Zoo. During the period that she was directing Zoo Atlanta, Maple maintained a part-time work with the university. Graduate psychology students from Georgia Tech were brought to Grant Park to conduct research on all kinds of animals, no matter how big or how small.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwwMSrqbJlnZa9rbGMqJmirKWWv7p5wK2jmqaklnqorYyfpqullad6u7vOZpitpJGjwaJ5w6KpnpukpL9utMCsZJ2hlZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
