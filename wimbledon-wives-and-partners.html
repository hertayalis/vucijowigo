In October 2019, Louise lost her job - at the time, Cameron asked her to join him at the Vienna Open. "When he asked me, I thought, 'I guess this guy doesn't live a normal life, and it's not like I can meet (him) down the street and go to dinner together,'" she said. "So I went on this trip and was only supposed to be in Vienna for five days, and things just went really wellâ€¦In some weird way, I was like, 'Thank God I got laid off when I did' because we were able to build the foundation of our relationship before Covid hit."</p><p id=e9hxWigPa6></p><p id=efgRbr45fm data-wc=18>There's no denying the wives and partners of Wimbledon players are integral to the narrative of the tournament.</p><figure class="videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff -recommended-video"><span class=videoPlayerStyleHeader_v1l4r7u3>Recommended video</span><span class=videoPlayerStyleTitle_v1pm0z4u>You may also like</span>WATCH: Inside Andy Murray's family life</figure><p id=eXlDBgEgVd1></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8eHyQb21uZ6eeuqO4xJ2mp2WnnsOmv4yapZ1loJa%2FtbrEq6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
