Instead, it’s the latest episode of <a href=#>Dick Wolf</a>'s new show.</p><p>The docuseries is one of the most popular shows on the streaming service. It details five true crime stories in New York City. The fourth episode is about Howard's stabbing death in 1996. Police suspected that Howard's wife and brother-in-law, Phillip’s uncle, conspired to have him killed. This entirely unfortunate series of events led Howard’s son to his current career. Where is Philip Pilmar now?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Philip Pilmar now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Philip is probably in a courtroom or preparing for a case. Currently, he's an Assistant United States Attorney. His desire to become a lawyer isn’t surprising considering the story of his father’s death.</p><p>The episode of Homicide: New York about Howard’s murder explains how he was found dead in his office. There was no sign of forced entry, no murder weapon, no signs of robbery, and no theft. It took 20 years for the killers, or who some people think are the killers, to be arrested. Philip was only 10 years old at the time of his dad’s murder.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Philip’s mom, Roslyn, and uncle, Even Wald, were convicted of Howard’s murder in 2019. They’re currently serving a 25-year jail sentence for the crimes. While this case is technically solved, Philip doesn't believe his mother killed his father.</p><p>Philip spoke in court and asked the judge for leniency at his mother and uncle's sentencing. In an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">48 Hours</a> released on Oct. 29, 2019, Philip’s comments from the court were shared. “Having my mom die in jail will not bring back my dad.”</p><p>He continued, “She raised me to be kind, to be loving, to value education, value hard work. She was there for me every step of the way when I struggled with the death of my dad.”</p><p>Philip’s comments didn't help his mother or uncle. The 25-year sentence was the maximum sentence they could receive.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Philip is a successful lawyer, practicing in New York on behalf of the United States of America.</h2><p>Philip graduated from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York University School of Law</a>. He currently works as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. In January 2024, he earned the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">General’s Award</a> for Distinguished Service from Attorney General Merrick Garland at the 70th and 71st Attorney General’s Awards Ceremony.</p><p>“Each of today’s recipients has served with distinction, and in so doing, they have enabled the Justice Department to advance its work on behalf of the American people,” said Attorney General Garland at the ceremony. “Their exceptional leadership, heroism, and dedication have benefited people and communities across the country.</p><p>All of the episodes of Homicide: New York are available to stream.
