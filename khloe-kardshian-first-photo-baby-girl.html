Reminder: This all comes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amid allegations that Thompson cheated</a> on Khloé with multiple women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While we received a glimpse of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>True's arm resting on mom's chest</a> in a filter-filled photo on Snapchat earlier this week, Khloé shared a new post on Saturday that gave us a clear look at the newborn. In her debut video, little True looks like, you know, a baby, meaning she’s cute, adorable, and doesn’t have a clue of what’s going on. Mom Khloé wrote as the caption, "Happy One Month True," celebrating her milestone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Happy one month old, mama,” Kardashian says in the video. “I love you, pretty girl.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Khloé confirmed her pregnancy in December, also on Instagram, with a photo of Thompson caressing her baby bump. “My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along,” she wrote, later clarifying why she chose to stay mum on her pregnancy for months.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Even though expecting a baby is SO exciting, the first trimester can be the worst. The worst part was keeping this major secret from my family, though! I’m with my sisters pretty much every single day, so it was hard not to be able to say why I was so sick or couldn’t do certain things. We wanted to tell everybody at one time, which made things even more tricky—how do you get all those people together in one room?!—but it was amazing when we finally did,” she shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Keeping the secret from the outside world wasn't as big of a deal for me," she explained. "I believe there are certain things that need to be held private and for yourself. It was beautiful to have something that was just ours."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The birth of her first child marks the end of an era. Khloé and little sister Kylie Jenner were pregnant together, while Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s surrogate carried their third child. Now, the family has officially welcomed Chicago West and Stormi Webster, plus True Thompson<strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGebnbmwsYykmKuco522orqMn6Crq6Rivam706hkm5mSrnqotdGl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
