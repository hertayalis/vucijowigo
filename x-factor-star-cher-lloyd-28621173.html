"I was a beast! Everyone hated me," Cher told Fabulous magazine back in 2012.</p><p>"I was young and foolish. Part of me was trying to show I was strong enough to do it, and then I think it all got too much for me. I was angry with the way I was being edited and because of that I turned into this horrible person, with a terrible attitude."</p><p>Cher was eliminated in the first round of the finals and ended up clashing with mentor Cheryl after she accused her of abandoning her. "I didn't have her mobile number to begin with. I've got more chance of winning the lottery than catching up with her," she said on the release of her hit single, Swagger Jagger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article23868370.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/3_Rebecca-Ferguson-demands-inquiry-into-music-industry-as-Jedward-and-Cher-slam-Simon-Cowell.jpg><p>And asked if she'd do a duet with Cheryl, Cher hit back with a barb about using autotune and challenged her mentor to sing live with her. Cheryl was raging and tweeted: "Be Careful who you kick on your way up .. They kick you twice as hard on your way back down.. #unappreciationisugly."</p><p>The pair later made it up, tweeting each other messages of congratulations on their wedding days. Cher married London hairdresser Craig Monk in 2013 and the couple share daughter Delilah-Rae.</p><h3 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border publication-font brand-bg">Top showbiz news</h3><p><b>Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.
