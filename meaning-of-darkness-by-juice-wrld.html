It delves into the darkness that envelopes the artist's mind as he grapples with his vices. This article will take a closer look at some standout lyrics from the song, unraveling unexpected and imaginative themes that tie back to the overarching theme of the song.The chorus, "As I blackout in the darkness, Drive the car, crash-it don't park it, Baby girl don't get me started, Too many xans I feel retarded," sets the tone for the song. It captures the artist's state of mind as he succumbs to the allure of the darkness. The use of the term "blackout" metaphorically represents the artist's descent into oblivion, losing control over his actions and emotions. The lyrics also hint at the dangerous mix of substance abuse and reckless behavior, symbolized by crashing the car. It portrays a self-destructive urge that arises in the artist, further highlighting his struggles.Moving onto the verse, the lines "Tell me in advance, do you got a man, Do you fuck with drugs, do you do the xans, I been on the percs, now I'm in a trance, I was up in Hell, Devil tryna dance," introduce the theme of companionship and drug-induced trance. These lyrics depict the artist seeking a connection with someone, perhaps to share his pain and experiences. However, it also suggests that his attraction towards someone is closely tied to their drug use, emphasizing the toxic nature of the relationships he forms. The mention of being in a trance after taking percs reflects the artist's desire to escape reality through drugs. The reference to Hell and the Devil attempting to dance signifies the internal struggle he faces between succumbing to self-destruction and seeking salvation.Another lyric that stands out is, "Had to sell my soul, did it for the bands, Now I'm taking trips, talking 'bout the shrooms, Then I take a trip, talking 'bout the France, Just to buy some pants, gucci on the bag." This verse explores the theme of materialism and the sacrifices an individual might make for temporary satisfaction. Selling one's soul for monetary gains represents the artist's desperation to escape his reality, even if it means compromising his integrity. The references to taking trips and buying luxury items like Gucci pants reflect the transient happiness that material possessions can bring. However, it also reveals the emptiness that lies beneath the surface, hinting at the hollowness that comes from relying on material things for fulfillment.As the song progresses, the bridge, "Revenge on my body, I do that a lot, I get that for free, Don't look at the tags as I collapse," introduces the motif of self-punishment and the desire for release. The artist's need for revenge on his own body reflects a deeper self-loathing and dissatisfaction. It suggests that he inflicts pain on himself as a form of catharsis or control in a chaotic world. The line "Don't look at the tags as I collapse" conveys the idea that material possessions lose their significance when faced with personal turmoil. It underscores the futility of seeking solace in superficial distractions when inner demons continue to haunt.In conclusion, the song "Darkness" by Juice WRLD delves into the artist's struggles with drugs, self-destruction, and the darkness that consumes him. The standout lyrics discussed in this article shed light on unexpected themes present in the song. These themes include the artist's allure towards reckless behavior, the toxic nature of relationships built on substance abuse, the search for temporary satisfaction through materialism, the desire for release through self-punishment, and the insignificance of material possessions in the face of internal turmoil. "Darkness" delivers a raw and honest portrayal of the artist's battles, reminding us of the harrowing journey individuals embark upon as they confront their demons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyrwcicnGavoqGxcLnEmqWippdivKd5w5qppKaVqMBurthmoa6hk5p6uL7LnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
