However, Ravens faithful publicly blamed poor play on offensive coordinator Greg Roman.</p><p>Searching “Greg Roman” on Twitter during the game turned up a lot of criticism of the seasoned coach.

Great day to Fire Greg Roman 😁 <a href=# rel=noopener>@Ravens</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Xtd0zC7a9Q</a></p><p>— 𝙕𝙖𝙘𝙝🦦® (@NewEraZach) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 19, 2022</a></p><p>In 2019, Roman was promoted to his current position as offensive coordinator after joining the club the previous year.</p><p>His prior stops as a head coach were with the Carolina Panthers, Houston Texans, San Francisco 49ers, Buffalo Bills, and Baltimore Ravens. At the collegiate and high school levels, he coached as well.</p><p>It’s possible that this is the first time in his lengthy career that fans have been so upset with him that they’ve risked arrest by trespassing to deliver handwritten cards to the Baltimore team facilities demanding that Roman be let go.</p><p>Tyus Bowser, a linebacker with the Ravens, made a TikTok clip of the notes. Despite Bowser’s best efforts, the video has now gone viral online.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyus Bowser shows a few “Fire Greg Roman” signs on the ground via his IG story (tyus23).

Instantly shut down the idea that it could happen and said he has faith in all his coaches <a href=# rel=noopener>#RavensFlock</a></p><p>— Cordell Woodland (@CordellWoodland) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 19, 2022</a></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Harbaugh also spoke to Bowser</a>, one of his players, over the latter’s social media post depicting supporters calling for the dismissal of a coach. He assured them that that is not an issue right now.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>John Harbaugh said he talked to Tyus Bowser about his IG story discovering pieces of paper with "Fire Greg Roman" on the ground at the facility. Harbaugh said Bowser talked to Greg about it.</p><p>"There's really not much there."</p><p>— Jonas Shaffer (@jonas_shaffer) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 19, 2022</a></p><p>Last but not least, the reporters questioned Harbaugh whether he was worried that the fan had gotten so near to the team’s facilities that he may leave notes. “It’s irrelevant to Harbaugh, so we won’t even bother.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>John Harbaugh was asked if he's interested in how the "Fire Greg Roman" papers got to the doorstep of the team facility:</p><p>"I don't care.
