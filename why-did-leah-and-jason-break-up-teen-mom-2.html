Facts."</p><p>The following day, Leah decided to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> vent via the ‘Gram</u></a> and posted the caption, "Everyone comes into our lives for a reason, a season or a lifetime. I’m thankful for everyone I’ve journeyed with and continue to learn and grow." Preach, girl!&nbsp;</p><p>However, as fans continued to question if her posts were about her “reported ex,” Leah finally set the record on her relationship straight. She tweeted: “Just to be very clear, Nothing that I post is in reference to my recent break up or Jason! I wish him the best!!!!” Ouch.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, why did Leah and Jason break up?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>This is certainly not the first time the two decided to end their relationship. Before the holidays, the MTV starlet said goodbye to her 40-year-old beau.</p><p>“It just wasn’t working,” a source told Us at the time. “They’re just not a good fit.”&nbsp;</p><p>The reality star also told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HollywoodLife.com</u></a> that her ex-beau was not in the right mindset to be in a committed relationship, saying, "He wasn’t in a great place in his life, and it is what it is. It’s fine."</p><p>Leah didn’t stay single for long and the two decided to give love another shot.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why Did Leah and Jason get back together?&nbsp;</h2><p>While the pair reconciled in late November, they reportedly ended their relationship at the beginning of of last month. The former couple initially met through Jordan’s cousin and were reportedly “getting serious” last July. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“They share the same faith and have gone to church together,” a source told Us Weekly at the time. And their 14-year age difference was seemingly not a negative factor in their relationship, the source cited, claiming: “Even though he’s older, they have a lot of common. They love hiking, cooking and are both very family oriented. He’s very attentive.”&nbsp;</p><p>While the couple decided to part ways, we can’t rule out a possible reunion. In Teen Mom world, you certainly never know what ex will pop back up on our TV screens. &nbsp;</p><p>For now, with her ex in her rearview mirror, Leah seems to be finding comfort with her daughters — &nbsp;Aliannah and Aleeah, 9, and Adalynn, 6. She recently posted a gorgeous Instagram pic of herself with the three girls, which she captioned, "They will forever be my reasoning for a successful and abundantly joyful simple LIFE! Everything I do, I do it for them."</p><p>&nbsp;Watch new episodes of Teen Mom 2 on Mondays at 9 p.m ET on MTV. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aklZa1bq3NnWSjmaOku26u0Z6YpGWlpXq1scSnZKannWJ%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
