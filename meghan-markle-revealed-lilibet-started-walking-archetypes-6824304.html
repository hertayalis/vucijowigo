"But for me, it's, you know, both monitors on for the kids to hear them, always up with Lili, get her downstairs, then a half hour later, Archie's up. I start doing his lunchbox right before he's up while I have her, getting her a little nibble. My husband's helping me get him downstairs.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “I make breakfast for all three of them. It's very important to me. I love doing it. To me, it just feels like the greatest way to start the morning.” Markle then added that she feeds her three dogs, Guy, Pula, and Mia, before finishing it off with a school drop off: “Then get Archie out the door for school, but it does, it feels like a whirlwind,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although it sounds like Meghan has her hands full around the house, she reassured listeners that Prince Harry certainly pulls his weight. When Aldon quipped that she hopes the Duke of Sussex helps with the kids, Markle replied, “Oh, my husband? He's great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGaqlauyorjEnWSloZyer6bAjKyrmqqkmrFuw8CloqKml2Kus6%2FHnquyqJWoeneEkW1qaWw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
