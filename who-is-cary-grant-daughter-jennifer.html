Her father, Cary Grant was born Archibald "Archie" Leach in 1904 in Bristol, England before moving to the U.S. and making a name for himself as a leading man in <a href=#>Hollywood's Golden Age</a>. An older father, Grant was attentive to his young daughter, as Jennifer told <a href=#>NPR's</a> Jacki Lynden in 2011. "He wanted me to have accurate records of my life growing up with him because his own records were burned in the bombings of Bristol in World War II," she said.</p><p dir=ltr>To do so, Cary taped and captured moments of Jennifer's childhood on Super 8 film and with slides and photographs. "[E]very note I wrote him, every note he wrote me — and letter — he saved in boxes. And he put them in a fireproof vault in our house to ensure the safety of these archives for me," she said. By 1987, Jennifer was on a far different path than what one might expect from the child of two Hollywood celebrities. She had just graduated from Stanford University with a history and political science degree and planned to attend law school. But all that changed once her father died, she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kmxqcG1oZMSpu4yiqmabkafGbrPRmqWtZZSWwqi0056pZqKVo7uqssSrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
